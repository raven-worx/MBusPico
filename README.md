> **NEW IN VERSION 2.0: ADDED MICROPYTHON AND PYTHON SUPPORT. RASPBERRY PI IS NOW SUPPORTED. ADDED READY-TO-USE DOCKER IMAGE**

This project was created mostly out of interest and the wish to read out and display my power meter data in my Loxone smart home setup. (Thus the option with the 24V power supply - see below)

Currently the only smart meter device supported is the **Kaifa MA309M** (Austrian power provider Netz NÃ–), but could be extended to any other model. Credits for the data intepretation code goes out to **[firegore/esphome-dlms-meter](https://github.com/firegore/esphome-dlms-meter)**!

The read meter data values are published via HTTP and/or UDP in JSON format:

## Software

There are two versions of MBusPico available:

There is a native Raspberry Pico application written in C using the following components:
* [pico-sdk](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk)
* [FreeRTOS](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel)
* [mbedtls](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls)
* [mongoose](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose)

And (since v2.0) there is also a Python/Micropython version available, using the following moduls:
* [microdot](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microdot)
* PySerial
* PyCryptodome

## Build (native application)

1. Download and extract [latest release archive](https://github.com/raven-worx/mbuspico/releases) - or clone repository: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/raven-worx/MBusPico.git`
2. Edit build options (see below) in `options.ini` to configure MBusPico application to your needs
3. start building (e.g. using Docker - see below)

### Linux

Simply run the `build.sh` script.

Make sure you have set the `PICO_SDK_PATH` environment variable pointing to your local pico-sdk checkout.
If you do not have a checkout of the pico-sdk yet, you can instead add the option `PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT=ON` in the `options.ini` file to automatically checkout the pico-sdk as part of the build process.

### Windows

For Windows i recommend using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for a quick and painless build.

You can also use the already available prebuilt docker image `ravenworx/pico-sdk-build:1.5.0` which contains already all required packages to build MBusPico.

```console
docker run -v ${PWD}:/opt/mbuspico --entrypoint=/opt/mbuspico/build.sh ravenworx/mbus-pico-build:1.5.0
```

Alternatively you can create a (local) docker image with the file provided in the `docker` folder of this repository.
```console
docker build -t my/mbuspico-build -f docker/Dockerfile
```
After the build of the docker image has finished (might take a few minutes) simply start the built with the `my/mbuspico-build` instead.

### Build options

| **Option**            | Default value | **required**            |  **Description** |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |  --------------- |
| MBUSPICO_DEVICE_KEY   |               | yes / device dependant  | Key used to decrypt data read from the meter. Must be requested from the power provider. |
| MBUSPICO_LOG_LEVEL    | LOG_ERROR     | no                      | level of log verbosity. Possible values: LOG_NONE, LOG_ERROR, LOG_INFO, LOG_DEBUG |
| MBUSPICO_WIFI_ENABLED | ON            | no                      | specifies if the device should connect to wifi network |
| MBUSPICO_WIFI_SSID    |               | yes, if MBUSPICO_WIFI_ENABLED | Wifi SSID to connect to |
| MBUSPICO_WIFI_PWD     |               | yes, if MBUSPICO_WIFI_ENABLED | Wifi password |
| MBUSPICO_WIFI_HOSTNAME | "MBusPico"   | no                      | The hostname of the Pico W device in the network |
| MBUSPICO_UDP_ENABLED  | OFF           | no                      | specifies if the device should send out the read meter data via UDP |
| MBUSPICO_UDP_RECEIVER_HOST |          | yes, if MBUSPICO_UDP_ENABLED | the UDP receiver address the meter data packet should be send to |
| MBUSPICO_UDP_RECEIVER_PORT |          | yes, if MBUSPICO_UDP_ENABLED | the UDP receiver port the meter data packet should be send to |
| MBUSPICO_UDP_INTERVAL_S | 30          | no                      | the maximum interval [sec] the meter data should be send out via UDP |
| MBUSPICO_HTTP_ENABLED | ON            | no                      | specifies if the device should launch a simple HTTP server to provide the read meter data |
| MBUSPICO_HTTP_SERVER_PORT | 80        | no                      | specifies the listening port for the HTTP webserver |
| MBUSPICO_HTTP_AUTH_USER |             | no                      | Protect access to data with authentication
| MBUSPICO_HTTP_AUTH_PWD |              | no                      | Protect access to data with authentication

## Transfer MBusPico onto the device

### Native application

Hold the BOOTSEL button on the Raspberry Pico W while connecting it to the PC via a USB cable. Since v1.2 its also possible to call `http://<ip-address>/update` to restart into the bootloader (if built with HTTP option).
The Pico will show up as a flash drive. Copy the `mbuspico.uf2` file from the build directory to the appeared flash drive. The Pico W will automatically reboot into the just flashed firmware after copying has finished. Done.

### MicroPython application

To copy MicroPython to the Raspberry Pico, hold the BOOTSEL button on the Raspberry Pico W while connecting it to the PC via a USB cable
and copy the `micropython.uf2` to the appeared flash drive.

> **Important:** MBusPico requires MicroPython with built-in support for AES-CTR ciphre, which is disabled by default in the official release builds.
> A prebuilt MicroPython version can be found in the python archive of each [MBusPico release](https://github.com/raven-worx/mbuspico/releases) (since v2.0 onwards), or in the `python` directory of this respository.

Now make sure you have adapted `config.py` to your needs before you copy all folders and files from `python/dist` to the Raspberry Pico:

For example you can use [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/) to transfer files to the Raspberry Pico.

Or via command line using python3/pip3 with the following commands.
On Windows make sure `python3.exe` can be found in the `PATH`. Probably the easiest is to install Python3 from the [Windows Marketplace](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-311/9NRWMJP3717K).

Install ampy CLI tool:
```console
pip3 install adafruit-ampy
```

Use ampy to copy files and folders to device. `<PORT>` must the serial port of the connected Raspberry Pico running MicroPython. e.g. Linux: `/dev/ttyS0`, Windows `COM5`
To see a list of available serial ports you can run `python3 -m serial.tools.list_ports`
```console
cd python/dist
ampy --port <PORT> put mbus
ampy --port <PORT> put provider
ampy --port <PORT> put config.py
ampy --port <PORT> put main.py
```

# HTTP endpoints

When built with `MBUSPICO_HTTP_ENABLED` option enabled the following HTTP endpoints are provided.

| **Method**    | **Endpoint URL**      | **Description**    |
| --------------| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| GET           | /                     | Return last read meter data in JSON format |
| GET           | /update               | Reboot device into USB bootloader for a quick and easy update of MBusPico application |
| GET           | /reboot               | Reboot device      |
